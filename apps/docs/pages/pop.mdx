# Pop

Pop is Cakepops atomic CSS engine. Vanilla Extract provides the <span><a style={{color:'blue', textDecoration: 'underline'}} href='https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/'>Sprinkles</a></span> API, allowing you to build your own zero-runtime, type-safe version of Tailwind, Styled System, etc. However, there are a few pitfalls to using this approach. Namely, large bundle size as atomic conditions scale, and no support for dynamic properties.

 Enter <span><a style={{color:'blue', textDecoration: 'underline'}} href='https://github.com/wayfair/rainbow-sprinkles'> Rainbow Sprinkles</a></span>. Some talented engineers from Wayfair built this to alleviate some of the drawbacks of the original Sprinkles.

 Pop is built on top of Rainbow Sprinkles to allow for a first class DX!
